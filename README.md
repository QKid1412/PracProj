# Proj2048

2048 game using Angular/TypeScript

<b>Have Done:</b></br>
  --> Basic 2048 game logic, using keyboard to play </br>
  --> Randomized generation of tiles (eg. when 64 is reached, 4 maybe generated instead of only 2, etc.)</br>
  --> Basic UI implementation</br>
  --> Game animations using angular/animations (sliding tiles)</br>
  --> New game button (for restart); Boom button (for eliminating the 2s in the grid)</br>
  --> Score tracking system (keep highest score using cookie Service)</br>
  --> Deployed to heroku using express</br>

<b>TODO: </b></br>
  --> Game Over/ Game Win/ Achieved new Best Score pop up (function's done, need UI)</br>
  --> Make UI responsive (adaptive to small screen/ touch screen)</br>
  --> Adjust Score Board UI</br>
  --> Add game instructions to webpage</br>
  --> Make Game board size selectable (For now, it's 2048 4x4 by default, make 5x5 possible)</br>
  --> Code Refactoring ***</br>

<b>Possibly Advanced changes:</b></br>
  --> Upgrade score system (Boom function associated with Score to make it more playable)</br>
  --> More animations (Score update, eg: +4, -8)</br>
  --> Upgrade Boom function (not only eliminate 2, possibly eliminate the smallest numbers from board)</br>
  --> Sound system along with game play</br>
  --> Rank Board (Not only store the Best Score, but Top 5, possibly with player names)</br>
