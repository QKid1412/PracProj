# Proj2048

2048 game using Angular/TypeScript

Have Done:
  --> Basic 2048 game logic, using keyboard to play
  --> Randomized generation of tiles (eg. when 64 is reached, 4 maybe generated instead of only 2, etc.)
  --> Basic UI implementation
  --> Game animations using angular/animations (sliding tiles)
  --> New game button (for restart); Boom button (for eliminating the 2s in the grid)
  --> Score tracking system (keep highest score using cookie Service)
  --> Deployed to heroku using express
  
TODO: 
  --> Game Over/ Game Win/ Achieved new Best Score pop up (function's done, need UI)
  --> Make UI responsive (adaptive to small screen/ touch screen)
  --> Adjust Score Board UI
  --> Add game instructions to webpage
  --> Make Game board size selectable (For now, it's 2048 4x4 by default, make 5x5 possible)
  --> Code Refactoring ***
  
Possibly Advanced changes:
  --> Upgrade score system (Boom function associated with Score to make it more playable)
  --> More animations (Score update, eg: +4, -8)
  --> Upgrade Boom function (not only eliminate 2, possibly eliminate the smallest numbers from board)
  --> Sound system along with game play
  --> Rank Board (Not only store the Best Score, but Top 5, possibly with player names)
